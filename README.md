# Welcome to FSnipe!

## What exactly is FSnipe?

F(ree)Snipe is a free Minecraft name sniper available for users to get the names that they want. This python bot is open sourced and is open to any sort of critique. The real goal with FSnipe was to create a sniper **template** for players to start coding and making this bot better. There has been a recent surge in the amount of people who want to get involved in sniping names - this brings more people to learning about different languages in computer science. Because Python is one of the easiest languages to start learning programming, I have created this template for use. If you do extend on this sniper layout, *do* tell me!

## Is it really free?

Yeah, it really is. You can just head over to the releases and download the .exe file. If you are a Mac user, *please* contact me - this sniper is also available for Mac users!
